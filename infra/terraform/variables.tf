# variables.tf: the only knobs. Everything else is a concrete, prefix-derived value
# (naming.tf) or a render-time constant (render.tf.json).
#
# Principle map (COMPLIANCE.md):
#   P-03 (residency): `region` is SELECTED AT DEPLOY TIME and validated against the residency
#         allowlist, so an unvetted region fails at `terraform plan` rather than putting
#         regulated data out of jurisdiction. Both default to the region this repo was
#         rendered for; the defaults live in render.tf.json because this file is copied into
#         a render verbatim, which is why the two variables are nullable here and made
#         effective in naming.tf.
#   P-07 (auditability and retention): `retention_days` is a variable because the WORM bucket
#         lock is irreversible, so the retention window has to be a deliberate decision.
#   P-06 / R8 (maker-checker): `human_review_url` is required when the serving edge is
#         enabled, because the managed review router refuses to swallow an escalation with no
#         console configured. A deploy that would ship R8 unwired fails at plan time.
#
# Two deploy paths are supported:
#   - QUICK EVALUATION (project-scoped, no org-level roles): project_id plus
#     enable_vpc_sc = false, enable_org_policies = false, worm_locked = false. Everything
#     stays deletable. NOT a compliant production posture.
#   - FULL SOVEREIGN (the default): org-policy guardrails, a dry-run VPC-SC perimeter, and a
#     locked WORM bucket.
