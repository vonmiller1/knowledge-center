"""FastAPI application for Meeting Knowledge Capture (H6).

Import-safe (the Container is built at request time, never at import; only ``Settings`` is read
at import, to learn which identity adapter is bound, and no adapter is constructed), identity is
a server-verified Principal (the client-asserted actor is discarded), S2S callers are
authenticated fail-closed, and the fail-closed network defaults come from the commons: a profile
that cannot authenticate an end user binds loopback unless explicitly opted out, and CORS never
falls back to ``*``.

The profile is resolved ONCE, by ``config.resolve_profile``, and an absent
``MEETCAP_PROFILE`` is NO CHOICE rather than a silent ``local``. Every
posture decision here keys off that one resolution, through the derived member that fails closed
in the right direction:

* the RELAXATIONS (CORS allowlist, the ``X-Dev-Persona`` allowed header, the HSTS baseline, the
  S2S scheme) key off ``exposure_profile``, where an unconsented run is ``unconfigured`` and
  therefore gets none of them;
* the RESTRICTION (the loopback bound) keys off ``bind_profile``, where an unconsented run is
  ``local`` and therefore stays on loopback.

One string could not do both: handing the relaxations ``local`` would grant a dev CORS
allowlist and the persona header to a deploy whose profile variable went missing, and handing
the restriction ``unconfigured`` would let that same deploy bind every interface.

The loopback bound lives on the APP OBJECT, not in ``main()``. The Dockerfile ``CMD`` and the
Makefile ``run-api`` target serve ``app`` directly, so a guard reachable only from ``main()``
never runs in a shipped process. ``add_loopback_exposure_guard`` is therefore registered at
module scope below, and ``resolve_bind_host`` in ``main()`` is the second layer rather than the
only one.

WHAT SWITCHES THE EXPOSURE GUARD OFF is one thing and one thing only: the identity adapter
bound to the identity port declaring that it VERIFIES the end user (see ``ports/identity.py``).
The guard exists to bound routes that answer an end user with no credential, so the question it
has to settle is whether an end user CAN be authenticated here, and only the bound adapter
knows. Deriving it from the profile string plus the presence of
``MEETCAP_S2S_TOKEN`` is wrong in the most dangerous direction:
that secret authenticates a calling SERVICE and no end user at all, so SETTING it disabled the
guard for exactly the end-user routes it was protecting. A LAN peer with no Authorization
header and no ``X-Dev-Persona`` then got the seeded persona list and a real triage decision.

THE INTERACTIVE DOCS ARE PART OF THAT EXPOSURE, and they are switched off with it. Under the one
profile whose guard deliberately stands down, an uncredentialed LAN peer would receive ``/docs``
and ``/openapi.json`` as 200: the complete route inventory, every request and response schema and
every field name, handed to a caller who cannot reach a single one of those routes. That is
reconnaissance with no counterpart benefit. Swagger UI and the raw OpenAPI document are a
development affordance, so they are served under the DELIBERATE offline ``local`` profile and
nowhere else (see ``_DOCS_URL`` below). There is deliberately no opt-in variable to re-enable
them: another three-state posture switch is another thing to get wrong, the schema is generated
from this file and available to anyone with the repo, and a deployment that wants to publish it
can serve the artifact from somewhere that is not the authenticated service.
