"""The deterministic triage service: pure decision, redact-before-audit, soft escalation.

The consequential decision (the severity band and whether to escalate) is pure stdlib and
replayable; an LLM would only narrate, never produce the band. PII is redacted BEFORE anything
is written to the audit sink (R1/P-04), every result carries a citation, and a consequential
result escalates softly to a human (P-06) rather than auto-executing.
