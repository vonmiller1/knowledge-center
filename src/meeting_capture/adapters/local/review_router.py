"""Local ReviewRouterPort: enqueue the routed review to an in-memory outbox (no live
human-review-console).

Exercises the R8 routing path offline. An escalated result is converted to a review and enqueued
into the same transactional outbox the managed adapter flushes to human-review-console, so the
offline gate, the tests and the demo can assert that an escalation was ROUTED, not merely flagged,
without a running console. The outbox is deliberately not a no-op: a silent local router would let a
producer ship with R8 unwired and a green gate.
