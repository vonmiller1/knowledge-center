"""Local IdentityPort: seeded dev personas (no IdP/AD/LDAP), from the commons.

These personas are an UNAUTHENTICATED grant: the caller names one in a request header and gets
its groups and tenant. That is fine for an offline demo and is not fine for a deployment whose
profile variable simply went missing, so this adapter refuses to construct unless the local
profile was chosen DELIBERATELY. The profile must actually be ``local`` AND (when the settings
came from the environment) ``MEETCAP_PROFILE`` must have been set rather
than inherited from the offline default.

That second half is the whole point. An adapter that only checked ``profile == "local"`` would
still hand out an approver persona to the internet the moment the variable dropped out of a
deployment's environment, because the inherited value and the chosen value are the same string.
The :class:`ProfileChoice` in ``config.py`` keeps them apart; this is where the difference
is spent.

    answer whether the cause is a bad persona name or an unconfigured deployment. It is the
