"""Managed ObservabilityTracerPort: OpenTelemetry, built by the commons.

This adapter is deliberately thin. All the OpenTelemetry work lives in
``hex_service_kit.tracing`` (the ``otel`` extra), so the exporter choice, the Cloud Run
authentication the Hrz5 collector requires, and the rule that a tracing fault never becomes a
request fault are implemented once for the whole fleet rather than per repo.

Where spans go is a DEPLOYMENT fact, not a code fact, and it is read from
``OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT``: set, they go OTLP to the Hrz5 collector, which redacts and
aggregates; unset, straight to Cloud Trace. Both are supported, so this is one adapter and not two
profiles.

The commons import is lazy for the usual reason (practice A5): the local and on-prem profiles
import this package with no cloud SDK installed, and ``hex_service_kit.tracing`` itself imports
clean without OpenTelemetry, but the extra may simply not be present.
