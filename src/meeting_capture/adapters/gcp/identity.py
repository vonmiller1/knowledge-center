"""GCP IdentityPort: verify the IAP-injected signed assertion (SDK imports stay lazy).

This adapter is the linchpin of the serving posture. It is the ONE shipped adapter that declares
``VERIFIED`` (see ``ports/identity.py``), and that declaration is the
single flag the exposure guard reads before it stands down and lets the process bind every
interface (``api/app.py``). So the verification has to be real, and every way it can fail has to
come out as a refusal rather than as a crash. Three things make that true, and all three were
once absent:

**1. The audience is verified, and it is CONFIGURATION.** ``id_token.verify_token`` documents
``audience=None`` as "the audience is not verified". Called without one, it accepts ANY
Google-signed OIDC ID token, from any project and any application, and hands back its claims, so
a token minted for an unrelated service becomes a verified :class:`Principal` here. The audience
is per-deployment (the IAP-protected resource), so it is read from settings, never written as a
literal, and it is three-state: UNSET and SET-AND-EMPTY both arrive as ``""`` and both REFUSE.
Verifying-without-an-audience is not a fallback this adapter has.

**2. The keys are IAP's keys.** ``certs_url`` defaults to the OAuth2 federated certificate set,
which is not the set IAP signs with. Pinning :data:`_IAP_KEYS_URL` means a token signed by any
other Google key set fails the signature check instead of reaching the claim reader.

**3. A crash is not a refusal.** ``google.auth.exceptions.MalformedError`` is a ``ValueError``
and a ``GoogleAuthError``; it is NOT an :class:`~hex_service_kit.identity.IdentityError`. Left
unwrapped it escaped ``get_principal`` entirely and FastAPI answered a bare 500 with no body, so
``X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion: not-a-jwt`` from an uncredentialed LAN peer got a stack-trace-shaped
nothing instead of a 401. The verifier call is wrapped, and so is the lazy import: a deployment
with the ``[gcp]`` extra missing cannot verify anybody, and it says that with a status and a
reason rather than crashing per request.

The refusals are split by who can act on them, which is the same split ``ports/identity.py``
draws. A malformed, expired, wrong-audience, wrong-issuer or wrong-key assertion is THIS
caller's problem: a plain :class:`~hex_service_kit.identity.IdentityError`, answered 401, with
the specific reason kept in the exception (and so in the log and the exception chain) rather
than handed to an unauthenticated caller who would be learning what to forge next. An
unconfigured audience or an uninstalled verifier is the DEPLOYMENT's problem: nobody can
authenticate here and no credential would have helped, so those raise
``EndUserAuthUnavailableError`` subclasses (``ports/identity.py``)
that carry their own status and their own message to the operator.

The Google SDK imports stay inside the method so the SDK-free ``local`` and ``onprem`` profiles
import this module with no cloud SDK installed.

#: repository has already made and none of it varies by deployment yet: no domain is mapped
#: to a tenant id, no domain is mapped to a group, and the hosted domain IS the tenant id
#: here.
#:
#: ``tenant_from_hosted_domain`` is ON, and it is an OPT-IN rather than a fallback. IAP
#: restricts the audience to one organisation on this deployment, so the ``hd`` claim and the
#: tenant partition are the same string. Left OFF, these same assertions would resolve to no
#: tenant at all: fail-closed, but closed for every verified user, and an offline gate would
#: not notice, because the local profile never constructs this adapter. Writing the choice
#: down is what makes it readable and testable; a silent fallback would be neither.
