"""Managed ReviewRouterPort: submit the routed review to Hrz7 via ``review-kit``.

Builds the review from the escalated result and submits it to the Hrz7 service intake
(``POST /v1/service/reviews``), authenticated as a trusted service caller. The console base URL
comes from ``review_url`` in ``config/settings.yaml`` (default ``${HRZ_HUMAN_REVIEW_URL:-}``,
the workspace-wide name the other producers use) and the credentials from the kit's own
``HRZ7_S2S_TOKEN`` / ``HRZ7_S2S_SIGNING_KEY``, which are the OUTBOUND pair and deliberately
distinct from this service's own inbound ``MEETCAP_S2S_TOKEN``.

No cloud SDK is involved: the kit is pure stdlib ``urllib`` with S2S headers wire-compatible
with ``hex-service-kit``'s server verifier, so this module imports cleanly with no GCP SDK
present. It is bound in the managed profile because it makes a real network call to a sibling
service.
