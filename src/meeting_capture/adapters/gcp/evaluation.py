"""Managed EvaluationGatePort: the model-quality-gate promotion authority over HTTP.

model-quality-gate owns the promotion verdict for the whole catalog (it is the E1/E2 gate owner), so
this adapter asks rather than decides. It carries no thresholds of its own: a repo that scored
itself and promoted itself would be a gate in name only.

The client comes from ``agent-eval-kit`` so the wire contract is shared with every other repo, and
it is constructed lazily because building a container must not require the quality service to be
reachable.
