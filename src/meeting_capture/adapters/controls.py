"""The runtime-control seam: what switched-off routing binds, and what a caller reports.

**Disabled adapter.** When a deployment switches review routing off
(``MEETCAP_REVIEW_ROUTING=off``), the container binds :class:`DisabledReviewRouter` instead of
the profile's class. It satisfies the port and submits nothing, and the container logs the
posture at startup.

**Recording wrapper.** Every caller that hands a result to the router wraps the bound router in
:class:`RecordingReviewRouter` for that one call, so what it returns can say what happened:
``routed``, ``failed``, ``off`` or ``not_required``. A failure is logged and absorbed here rather
than failing an already-audited triage or meeting capture, but it is never invisible: the caller
reports ``failed`` and an empty reference, which nobody can mistake for a reviewed result.
