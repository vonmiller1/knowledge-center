"""Fail-closed declaration for the managed profile.

The repository is a complete offline product, but the operations below are still explicit
managed-adapter placeholders. A Cloud Run service must not become healthy while any operation
on its primary journey is construction-only: that would turn production ready into a label.
The API process preflight therefore refuses before Uvicorn starts when a managed profile still
selects one of these adapters.

Remove an entry only when the adapter executes the real managed service call and its integration
test proves the response mapping. Set Terraform's managed_profile_implemented local to true
only when this tuple is empty.
