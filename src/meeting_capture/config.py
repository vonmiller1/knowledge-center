"""Settings + Container: profile-driven dependency injection (the hexagon wiring).

One env var (``MEETCAP_PROFILE``) selects the adapter family for every
port. ``local`` is the SDK-free offline default (dev/test/CI); ``gcp`` is the managed cloud
stack (SDK imports stay lazy so ``local``/``onprem`` import with no cloud SDK installed);
``onprem`` is the fail-fast portability placeholder. The dotted ``module:Class`` binding table
is the single source of truth, exactly like the reference build, and it lives in
``config/settings.yaml`` so a deployment can rebind a port without a code edit. The table below
is the shipped default that file carries; ``tests/test_settings_file.py`` fails the build if the
two ever disagree, so there is no second place for a binding to hide.

The profile read resolves FOUR outcomes from the three states of one variable, and never folds
two of them together:

* **UNSET** - nobody chose. The adapter family is still ``local`` (the alternative is importing
  cloud SDKs that are not installed), but :attr:`ProfileChoice.explicit` is False, so the
  seeded-persona identity adapter refuses to construct, the S2S dependency has no scheme to
  pick, and every relaxation sees :data:`UNCONSENTED_PROFILE` rather than ``local``.
* **SET AND EMPTY** - an intent WAS expressed and it names no profile. It raises
  :class:`~hex_service_kit.netdefaults.ConfiguredEmptyError`, so it can never inherit the unset
  default. An empty string is not a profile any more than it is a host to bind.
* **SET AND UNKNOWN** raises, including the merely mis-capitalised ``Local`` / ``LOCAL`` /
  ``GCP``: a typo must not silently downgrade the posture, and it must not silently fall
  through to some other family's adapters either.
* **SET AND VALID** selects that family, deliberately.

The result is a frozen :class:`ProfileChoice`, never a bare string, because the RELAXATIONS and
the RESTRICTIONS fail closed in OPPOSITE directions and a single "effective profile" string
would harden one while weakening the other. See :attr:`ProfileChoice.exposure_profile` and
:attr:`ProfileChoice.bind_profile`.

Every ``${VAR}`` reference inside the settings file resolves the same three states, through the
same helper the adapters use: UNSET takes the ``${VAR:-default}`` default, SET-AND-EMPTY RAISES
:class:`~hex_service_kit.netdefaults.ConfiguredEmptyError` rather than inheriting that default or
resolving to empty (an operator who emptied a value expressed an intent, and it names nothing),
and SET-AND-VALID wins. That refusal happens at load, so a service configured with an emptied
base URL, allowlist or path fails in the deploy instead of serving on a posture nobody chose.
