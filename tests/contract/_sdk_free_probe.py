"""Construct every adapter of one profile in a FRESH interpreter with the cloud SDKs blocked.

Run as ``python -m tests.contract._sdk_free_probe <profile>``; exits 0 when every port of that
profile imported and constructed, non-zero with the offending module otherwise.

Why a subprocess rather than a fixture that reloads modules in place: reloading rebinds the
adapter classes, so every already-imported test module would keep a stale class object and
``isinstance`` checks elsewhere in the suite would start failing for reasons that have nothing
to do with the code under test. A fresh process proves the stronger claim anyway (a whole
interpreter that never had the SDK available) and leaves the running suite untouched.
