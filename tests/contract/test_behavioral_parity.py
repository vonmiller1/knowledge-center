"""Behavioural parity: the SAME canonical request through every implementation of every port.

``test_port_parity`` proves each adapter *satisfies* its Protocol. Structural conformance is
cheap to fake: a family of methods that all return ``None`` passes it. This suite proves the
stronger claim the no-lock-in promise (P-02) actually rests on, for one canonical request per
port:

* ``local``  : the offline family ANSWERS. It records what it was given, resolves a real
  principal, produces a routing reference. A silently empty offline stack is the failure mode
  that lets a repo ship a green gate and no working profile.
* ``onprem`` : the migration placeholder RAISES ``NotImplementedError``. A placeholder that
  returned successfully would be a false portability claim, and for the review router it would
  convert every consequential result into an unreviewed one.
* ``gcp``    : the managed family, with nothing reachable, refuses in its documented way. Never
  a silent success.

Plus the boundary-payload proof: what the offline family puts on the wire when it flushes is
exactly what the managed family submits, because both build it from the same shared converter.
That is what makes "the offline profile exercises the R8 path" a real statement rather than a
different code path that happens to be green.
