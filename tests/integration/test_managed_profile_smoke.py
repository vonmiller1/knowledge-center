"""Managed-profile smoke: the gcp family against REAL services. Never part of the offline gate.

Marked ``integration`` at module scope, so ``pytest -m 'not integration'`` deselects the whole
file and the gate stays offline, credential-free and SDK-free. Run it deliberately
(``make test-integration``) against a project you are willing to write audit records into.

Each test skips rather than fails when its configuration is absent: an unconfigured machine has
not proved anything, and reporting that as a pass would be worse than reporting nothing.
