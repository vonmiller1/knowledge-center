"""Canonical synthetic cases, shared by the unit and contract suites.

Every party is obviously fictional and every address is an ``.example`` domain or an RFC 5737 /
RFC 3849 literal. One canonical escalating case and one canonical routine case are enough for
the contract suite: parity means the SAME request through every implementation, so the request
has to have one home rather than being retyped per test.
