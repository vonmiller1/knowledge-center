"""Shared fixtures for every suite: the REAL local adapters, never bespoke fakes.

The offline implementation must live in exactly one place, so the unit suite drives
``adapters/local`` rather than a parallel set of in-memory doubles that can drift from it. Every
adapter constructs from a single ``Settings`` pointed at ``:memory:``, which is also the adapter
convention the contract suite asserts.

``no_cloud_sdk`` is the portability harness: it makes ``google`` and every submodule
UNIMPORTABLE for the duration of a test, so "the SDK-free profiles construct with no cloud SDK"
is proved by blocking the import rather than by hoping the machine has none installed.
