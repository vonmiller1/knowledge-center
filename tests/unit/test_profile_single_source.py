"""The profile has ONE source of truth, it is three-state, and a bad value dies AT IMPORT.

Guarding a fail-open profile read in the identity adapter alone leaves it open anyway, because
`api/app.py` re-derives the same decision with its own raw fallback. That is the shape of the
bug: a permissive default gets reintroduced one module at a time, and every individual
reintroduction looks harmless. So a drift guard is part of the defence rather than a nicety,
and a rendered repo is born with it.

Three states of one variable, resolved into four outcomes and never folded together:

* UNSET means NOBODY CHOSE. The adapter family is still `local` (the alternative is importing
  cloud SDKs that are not installed), but `explicit` is False, so the seeded-persona adapter
  refuses, no S2S scheme is selected, and every relaxation sees `UNCONSENTED_PROFILE`;
* SET AND EMPTY raises `ConfiguredEmptyError`. It must never inherit the unset default: a
  variable an operator deliberately emptied is an expressed intent that names no profile;
* SET AND UNKNOWN raises, including a merely mis-capitalised `Local` / `LOCAL` / `GCP`;
* only SET AND VALID selects an adapter family.

Asserting the opposite of the first two, with a
`test_an_absent_or_blank_variable_is_the_offline_default` requiring `resolve_profile({})`,
`resolve_profile({VAR: ""})` and `resolve_profile({VAR: "   "})` to be indistinguishable from a
chosen `local`, would PIN the fail-open: a repo owner who closed the resolver would break a
green test and could reasonably revert. The three states are asserted separately
below, so this file is the standing regression guard rather than a guard on the defect.

The generalised form of the same drift guard, covering every security-relevant environment read
rather than only the profile, lives in `tests/unit/test_three_state_env_reads.py`.
