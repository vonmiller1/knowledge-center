"""The IAP verifier, branch by branch, with NO cloud SDK: the adapter's own half of the claim.

This adapter is the one that declares
``VERIFIED`` (see ``ports/identity.py``), and that declaration is the
single flag the exposure guard reads before it lets the process bind every interface. Leaving
it the one adapter with NO tests at all is how three defects sit in three lines of it while the
whole gate stays green: ``resolve`` carrying ``# pragma: no cover - needs live GCP`` and a suite
exercising only the header-absent branch prove nothing about the branch that matters.

    claims = id_token.verify_token(assertion, ga_requests.Request())

1. **no ``audience=``.** google-auth documents ``audience=None`` as "the audience is not
   verified". ANY Google-signed OIDC ID token, from any project or any application, was accepted
   and its ``email`` became the verified subject.
2. **no ``certs_url=``.** The default is the OAuth2 federated key set, not the set IAP signs
   with, so the signature check was against the wrong keys.
3. **no ``try``.** ``google.auth.exceptions.MalformedError`` is a ``ValueError``, not an
   ``IdentityError``, so it escaped ``get_principal`` and FastAPI answered a bare 500. Proved
   over the wire: ``X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion: not-a-jwt`` from a LAN peer, twice, once with
   google-auth installed and once without.

Everything here runs with the google modules FAKED or BLOCKED, so it needs no cloud SDK, no
project and no network, and it runs in every rendered repo's ``make gate``. What a fake verifier
cannot prove is that the REAL verifier rejects a wrong audience, an expired token or a signature
from the wrong key; that is ``tests/unit/test_iap_crypto_matrix.py``, which mints assertions with
a locally generated key and runs google-auth over them for real.
