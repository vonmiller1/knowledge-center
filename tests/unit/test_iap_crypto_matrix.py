"""The negative matrix against a locally minted key: the REAL verifier, offline, no live GCP.

``test_iap_identity.py`` proves the adapter's own half with google-auth faked. A fake cannot
prove the half that matters most, because the fake is the thing under suspicion: that the
arguments the adapter passes actually cause google-auth to REJECT a wrong audience, an expired
token, a signature from the wrong key or a string that is not a JWT at all. Verified with
``audience=None`` (the defect) every one of those cells except the malformed one PASSES, and the
adapter would hand back a :class:`Principal` built from an attacker-chosen ``email``.

So this mints its own RSA key, signs its own assertions with it, serves its own public key from
an in-process transport, and runs the REAL ``google.oauth2.id_token.verify_token`` over the
result. No network, no project, no credential: the only thing faked is the HTTP fetch of the key
set, and the fake ASSERTS that the URL requested is IAP's published one, so the ``certs_url``
half of the fix is proved by the same harness.

WHY THIS MODULE MAY NOT SILENTLY SKIP. google-auth is in ``requirements-gcp.lock`` and not in
``requirements-dev.lock``, so the SDK-free ``make gate`` cannot import it. A module that just
skipped there would leave the fleet's most load-bearing adapter proved by nothing on the only
gate most people run. So the skip is CONDITIONAL ON AN ENVIRONMENT FLAG: where the runtime
lockfile is installed, the gate sets ``MEETCAP_REQUIRE_IAP_MATRIX=1`` and
a missing google-auth becomes a hard ERROR instead of a skip. The template's own render gate and
the shared hard-gate workflow's ``iap-verifier`` job both set it, and the render gate asserts the
module reported PASSED rather than skipped.
