"""The `ui/` micro-frontend's posture, asserted from the offline gate with no node installed.

Two jobs.

**Consistency in both directions.** A `ui/` with no npm dependabot ecosystem is an unwatched
lockfile; an npm ecosystem with no `ui/` is a dependabot error on every run; a `ui/` with no CI
job is a UI nobody builds. So all three are checked to agree, whichever way the repo went, and
`make drop-ui` exists to make agreeing a single step.

**The identity boundary, from the source.** The UI's security value is that the browser cannot
assert who it is. That claim is proved properly by `npm test`, which runs in the ui-gate
workflow; here it is held to the wall by cheap source assertions so that deleting the policy, or
quietly relaxing it to a wildcard, fails the SAME command a developer runs before committing,
without needing a JavaScript toolchain in the Python gate.

The source assertions are a backstop, not the guard. The guard for the environment reads is
`ui/tests/three-state-env-reads.test.mjs`, which scans this whole directory in bare node;
`tests/unit/test_three_state_env_reads.py` cannot, because it parses Python with `ast`. What is
asserted here is that the node-side guard EXISTS, runs in the command CI runs, and carries the
mutant that proves it can go red. A guard that can be deleted without failing anything is a
guard that will be.

    them by hand does not hold, because the next `next dev` writes them again.
