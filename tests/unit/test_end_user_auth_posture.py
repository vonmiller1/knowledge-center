"""The exposure guard is derived from the IDENTITY BINDING, and from nothing else.

The defect this file is the standing guard for: the guard's ``unauthenticated`` argument used to
read

    bind_profile == local AND profile chosen AND MEETCAP_S2S_TOKEN unset

so SETTING the service-to-service secret switched the guard OFF. An adversarial verifier ran a
zero-hand-edit render bound to ``0.0.0.0`` with the profile chosen deliberately as ``local`` and
that secret set (an ordinary deployment shape) and, from a LAN peer with no Authorization header
and no ``X-Dev-Persona``, got ``/v1/personas`` with the full seeded persona list including the
approver's groups and tenant, and ``/v1/triage`` with a real escalated decision written to the
review outbox.

The cause is worth stating precisely, because widening the boolean would have hidden it rather
than fixed it: **the S2S token authenticates a calling SERVICE and authenticates NO END USER.**
The presence of a service credential is not evidence that end-user routes are authenticated. So
the guard now asks the only thing that knows: the identity adapter the active binding names,
which DECLARES whether it can produce a verified principal without trusting a header the client
wrote (``ports/identity.py``).

Three things are proved here, and the third is the one that stops the defect returning in a
different shape:

1. every shipped identity adapter declares, explicitly, what it does;
2. the declaration is what ``config.end_user_auth_kind`` reports, including when a settings file
   REBINDS the port (the documented on-premises path) and when the binding cannot be resolved
   at all, where it fails closed;
3. the guard's argument, expanded through the module constants it names, mentions no service
   credential anywhere. A scanner with a mutant that must go red, because the defect is
   exactly one indirection deep and passes any check that only reads one line.
