"""The loopback bound is a property of the APP OBJECT, not of ``main()``.

The defect this guards is invisible to a test that only calls ``main()`` or only reads
``resolve_bind_host``: the Dockerfile ``CMD`` and the Makefile ``run-api`` target serve the
``app`` object, so a bound that lives only in ``main()`` never runs in a shipped process.

The second half is the posture the app object is BUILT with, and it is the reason this file
re-imports the module under a scrubbed environment. An app assembled while the profile variable
is absent must not be indistinguishable from one assembled under a deliberate ``local``: same
CORS allowlist, same ``X-Dev-Persona`` header, same open S2S path, and, with an S2S token set,
an exposure guard switched OFF. That is a production deployment whose profile variable went
missing answering a stranger on the LAN with a seeded approver persona. Every route must refuse
instead, and "every" includes ``/healthz`` and the agent card: a deployment nobody configured
has no business being reachable at all.

The third half, and the reason the second was not enough: SETTING
``MEETCAP_S2S_TOKEN`` used to switch the guard off under a DELIBERATE
``local`` too, because the guard only ever covered the zero-secret demo. That is an ordinary
deployment shape, not a misconfiguration, and it served a LAN peer the seeded persona list and a
real triage decision. A service credential authenticates a calling SERVICE and no end user, so
the guard now reads the identity BINDING instead (see
``tests/unit/test_end_user_auth_posture.py`` for the derivation and its drift guard). Both
directions are proved below: the seeded-persona and unimplemented bindings refuse a LAN peer
whatever the token says, and a VERIFYING binding stands the guard down, which is the control
that keeps the first claim from being true for the boring reason.

The three-state resolution behind these postures is proved in
``tests/unit/test_profile_single_source.py``; here it is spent on real requests.

# A CONFIGURED wildcard origin is a boot refusal, and it is owned here rather than only in the
# commons.
#
# `cors_allowlist` promised "Never returns `*`, in any state" and for a long time did not keep
# it: a configured `*` was treated as one ordinary explicit origin and handed straight back.
# This app feeds that list into `CORSMiddleware` with `allow_credentials=True`, and Starlette
# reads allow-all-plus-credentials as ECHO THE REQUEST ORIGIN, so the result was not an inert
# literal star. It was a credentialed any-origin policy: any site a signed-in reviewer visited
# could call this service from their browser, with their session, and read the reply.
#
# The kit now raises `InsecureCorsError` instead. Because the call sits at MODULE scope beside the
# rest of the posture, adopting it turns a configured wildcard into a refusal at BOOT rather
# than a surprise on some later cross-origin request: the process that would have served the
# policy never starts, which is the same fail-closed shape as the profile resolution above.
#
# The property is pinned here, on THIS app, and not left to the commons alone. The kit's own
# test for it passed for years while reading a different variable than it set, and a repo that
# trusts an upstream test for its own boundary has no way to notice that.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
#: Wildcards the allowlist must refuse, in two halves, because each half catches what the other
#: misses. The partial asterisk forms matter as much as the bare one: a host-source wildcard
#: trusts every subdomain, including one an attacker obtains by takeover and one that serves user
#: content, and no legitimate origin contains the character.
#:
#: The second half is the tokens that are wildcards by BEHAVIOUR rather than by spelling, which no
#: asterisk test can see. `null` is the load-bearing one: a browser sends `Origin: null` from a
#: sandboxed iframe, from a `file://` document and after some cross-origin redirects, so an
#: allowlist admitting it hands the credentialed session to any page that can sandbox a frame,
#: which is any page at all.
#:
#: That half is pinned HERE, for the same reason the block above gives for the first half. The kit
#: refuses these tokens, but `ui/lib/embed-policy.mjs` has always carried its own `WILDCARDS` set
#: covering exactly these tokens, so leaving the Python side leased from the commons had one repo
#: enforcing one rule in two places to two different depths. A pin that did not carry that refusal
#: would re-admit `null` with every test in this repo still green, and a repo that cannot go red
