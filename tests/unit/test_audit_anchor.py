"""The external head anchor is WIRED, so a truncated audit trail is detectable (check C9).

The runbook has always told the operator to keep an anchor on a different volume. That is only
advice unless the service can actually be configured to write one, so this suite proves the
whole path: ``config/settings.yaml`` -> ``Settings.audit_anchor_path`` -> the commons audit log.

Why it matters, precisely: the hash chain detects an in-place edit, an interior deletion and a
reorder, because each of those breaks a link. It CANNOT detect a truncated tail, because
dropping the newest rows leaves a shorter chain that verifies perfectly. The tests below assert
both halves of that: with an anchor the truncation is caught, and without one the same
truncation passes unnoticed. The second assertion is the point. It is what stops the anchor from
being quietly dropped later by someone who reads the first test as "the chain catches tampering".
