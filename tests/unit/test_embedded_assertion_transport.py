"""The header an assertion arrives under once this service is EMBEDDED, and what it costs.

**The contradiction this module exists to resolve.** ``test_iap_identity.py`` already asserts
that a verified assertion resolves to a principal, and it passes. A sibling application asserting
the same thing still answered ``401`` to every authenticated caller the day it was deployed
behind the portal. Both are true, and the reason is that every test in that file hands the
adapter its assertion like this:

    RequestContext(headers={_IAP_ASSERTION_HEADER: signed_assertion()})

``_IAP_ASSERTION_HEADER`` is ``x-goog-iap-jwt-assertion``, the one header production never
delivers to an embedded application. ``x-goog-*`` is Google's reserved namespace and the
serverless frontend REMOVES that whole namespace from a request entering a service, so an
embedding host behind IAP cannot forward what its own edge handed it: the host sets the reserved
name, the frontend drops it, and the service refuses "request did not pass through IAP" about a
request that passed through IAP one hop earlier. The broker sends the same value as
``x-portal-iap-assertion`` as well, precisely because that name is NOT reserved.

So the suite next door models the CLAIMS faithfully and models the TRANSPORT wrongly. It is right
about what it asserts and silent about the half that fails, which is the shape of a test that
builds its own request: the fixture chooses the header, so it can only ever choose the one the
author had in mind.

**What was observed failing first.** On 2026-09-12 two applications were deployed on the same
day and both refused a service-account caller through the portal's IAP edge, while a third,
deployed a week earlier through the same hosts with the same audience, answered it. The kit
release, the audience, the host and the proxy were all excluded by execution. The difference was
one line, and it is the line these tests pin. The refusal was also invisible to a browser
walkthrough, because a console's first calls need no identity at all.

Nothing here needs a cloud SDK, a project or a network: the cryptography is either stubbed or
blocked outright, and every check this adapter owns before and after the verifier still runs.
