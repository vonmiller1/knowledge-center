"""The signing algorithm and the claim set are this deployment's decision, not the token's.

Catalog work item 3 tier 1 (surface parity) asks for accepted signing algorithms and required
claims to be pinned explicitly rather than inherited from whichever verifier library the adapter
happens to call. Before this, `google.oauth2.id_token.verify_token` chose the algorithm from the
token's own header, which is the attacker telling the verifier how to check the attacker's token.

Three properties are proved here, and the third is the one that stops the pin being decorative:

1. the adapter binds the COMMONS refusals, by object identity rather than by name, so a
   look-alike helper or a stale import cannot satisfy this file;
2. each refusal actually fires on the token shape it exists for, exercised on a laptop with no
   cloud SDK installed, which is the whole reason the pin is stdlib and sits outside the lazy
   google import;
3. the algorithm pin is called BEFORE the verifier in `resolve`, read off the source with an
   AST walk. A pin that runs after the token has already been verified is a pin that never
   protected the verifier, and nothing about its presence alone would show that.
