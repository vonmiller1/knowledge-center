"""Every security-relevant environment read resolves THREE states, proved by scanning the source.

The profile guard in ``test_profile_single_source.py`` watches ONE variable. That is not enough,
and this catalog has the scar to prove it: that guard was in place and green while two-state reads
of OTHER variables survived (a shipped ``frame-ancestors``, an audit path that fell back to an
in-memory log when emptied, an IAP audience that fell back to "verify no audience"). The defect
class is the READ, not the variable.

``os.environ.get(name, default)`` and ``os.getenv(name, default)`` collapse three states into two:

    unset          -> nobody expressed an intent, so a documented default may stand
    set and empty  -> an intent WAS expressed and it names nothing, so fail closed
    set with value -> use it

The middle state is the dangerous one. Folded into the first, a value an operator deliberately
emptied inherits the default, and where that default is the more permissive branch (a dev CORS
allowlist, a shipped ``frame-ancestors``, an in-memory audit log, an offline profile) emptying a
variable OPENS the service. ``hex_service_kit.netdefaults.read_env_setting`` returns an
``EnvSetting`` whose ``is_unset`` / ``is_configured_empty`` / ``has_value`` are mutually
exclusive, so the middle state has somewhere to go.

So this test fails the build on ANY two-state read in the shipped source, and the two escapes
from it are both narrow and both written down:

1. an EXACT-MATCH relaxation: the raw value compared against a literal,
   ``os.environ.get(X) == "1"``. There is no default to inherit and no truthiness to be
   surprised by, so unset, emptied and ``"0"`` alike all mean "no". This is the shape the commons
   itself uses for the insecure-demo opt-in, and it fails closed by construction;
2. a variable named in ``TWO_STATE_READS_WITH_A_REASON`` below, which carries no posture at all.
   Each entry needs a written reason, and a second test fails the build when an entry stops
   matching anything, so the exemption list cannot quietly outlive its reads.

``tests/`` is not scanned. A test harness legitimately manipulates the environment, and none of
it ships. Writes (``os.environ[X] = v``) are not reads and are not flagged; only ``Load`` context
counts, or a demo script pinning its own profile would read as a defect.

SCOPE LIMIT: this module parses Python with ``ast``, so no ``.mjs``/``.ts``/``.tsx`` file is ever
read. A repo with a browser tier needs the same rule expressed in that tier's own language (the
shape used here is ``ui/tests/three-state-env-reads.test.mjs``, run by ``npm test``); a
``env.UI_TENANT_ORIGINS || "*"`` once survived this entire gate because nothing scanned it.
