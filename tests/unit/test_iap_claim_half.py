"""The CLAIM half of the IAP adapter: one reviewed decision, not a local copy of one.

Signature verification stays in the adapter, because it needs a cloud SDK and
``hex_service_kit``'s core is pure standard library. Everything AFTER the signature -- which
string is the subject, which partition is the tenant, which entitlement principals the caller
holds, what assurance the audit record carries -- is a single authorization decision that was
replicated in fifty adapters, and it is now
:func:`hex_service_kit.federation.principal_from_iap_claims`.

**What was observed failing first, before the adapter changed.** Every test below was run
against the adapter exactly as it shipped:

* ``test_the_claim_half_is_the_commons_decision_and_not_a_local_copy`` failed on the ``acr``
  row and on the mixed-case ``hd`` row. The shipped tail hardcoded ``assurance="iap"`` and
  ignored an ``acr`` the commons prefers, and it passed the ``hd`` claim through with only
  ``.strip()`` where the commons lower-cases it. Both are recorded as findings in
  ``docs/practices-audit.md``: they are behaviour changes, not formatting.
* ``test_the_hosted_domain_passthrough_is_an_opt_in_this_deployment_made`` failed with
  ``AttributeError``: there was no policy object to read, which is exactly the state in which
  a load-bearing tenant can be emptied by a default nobody wrote down.
* ``test_a_claim_set_from_another_issuer_cannot_become_a_principal`` failed by RETURNING a
  principal. With the claim-set precheck removed, the hand-rolled tail read ``claims["email"]``
  and built a verified identity out of a token issued by somebody else. The commons refuses it
  a second time, which is what makes the precheck a defence in depth rather than the only
  defence.

The knobs were also flipped deliberately after the change: setting
``include_subject_principal=True`` turns
``test_this_family_withholds_the_verified_subject_its_own_principal`` red, and clearing
``tenant_from_hosted_domain`` turns the passthrough test and the ``hd`` rows of the
comparison red. A guard that cannot be made to fail is not a guard.
