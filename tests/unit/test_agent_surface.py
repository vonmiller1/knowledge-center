"""The agent surface is real, import-safe and cannot drift from the card it publishes.

Three failures this suite exists to prevent, all of which a scaffolded surface invites:

1. **A card that lies.** A skill advertised with no tool behind it, or a tool nobody can
   discover. The set equality below is the standing gate.
2. **A third place an escalation stops.** The API and the CLI both route an escalated result to
   human review. If the agent path only returned the flag, rule R8 would hold on two surfaces
   out of three, which is the same as not holding.
3. **A surface that quietly needs a runtime.** The tools must import and run with no ADK and no
   cloud SDK, or the offline gate stops being offline the day somebody calls one.
