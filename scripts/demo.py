"""The scripted, offline demo: the REAL services, synthetic data, an audit-first output view.

This is the demo as CODE (practices check F1), not a slide deck and not a recording. Every step
below drives the actual triage service, the actual hash-chained audit store and the actual
rule-R8 review router over the ``local`` profile, so a step that stops being true stops passing
rather than stops being mentioned.

Three properties make it worth running in front of somebody:

* **Nothing is faked.** No stub service, no pre-baked JSON. The severity bands, the audit
  records, the routing references and the tamper verdict are produced by the shipped code.
* **It is bounded.** The demo proves an offline, single-process seam. It does not prove
  cross-host deployment, a live console, or the managed profile; those need a cloud project and
  live in ``tests/integration/``.
* **It is replayable.** Same inputs, same output, every time, because the consequential decision
  is deterministic. That is what makes it safe to run live.

Run it directly to write the audit-view JSON, then render that JSON to static pages::

    make demo-static

or drive it one step at a time with ``demo_server.py`` and ``walkthrough.py`` (``make demo``).

Every party, address and identifier here is obviously fictional: ``.example`` domains, RFC 5737
and RFC 3849 literals, and a synthetic national id that exists only to prove redaction happened.

MAINTAINER NOTE: this file is rendered from a template, so no line may change length with the
package or service name. Every cookiecutter value is bound to a short module constant below and
referenced through it, and every import line is short enough that a long package name cannot
push it past the formatter's limit.
