"""The executable portability claim (practices check F3): named checks, pass or fail, exit code.

A portability claim written in a README is a sentence. This is the same claim as a program: it
runs every port through every profile, proves the offline family answers and the exit family
refuses, proves the audit record survives leaving this codebase, and exits non-zero the moment
one of those stops being true.

WHAT IT PROVES

* every declared port has a binding in every profile, in all of the places a binding lives;
* every adapter constructs from one ``Settings`` and satisfies its Protocol;
* the offline family ANSWERS a canonical call (not merely "did not raise");
* the exit family REFUSES loudly rather than dropping the work;
* the audit trail is tamper-evident, and an anchored trail also detects a truncated tail;
* the trail exports to an open format, carries its chain anchor with it, and reloads into a
  foreign store with its chain intact while a truncated export is refused;
* none of the above imports a cloud SDK.

WHAT IT DOES NOT PROVE

* that an on-premises deployment exists, or that anyone has run one;
* infrastructure, model, network or whole-system portability;
* anything at all about the managed profile's live behaviour, which needs a cloud project and
  lives in ``tests/integration/``.

Bounding the claim is the point. An unbounded claim is the one an auditor disproves for you.
