// The embedding security policy, as pure functions with no framework and no I/O.
//
// It lives in one plain module, imported by BOTH the proxy (which sets response headers), the
// API route (which decides CORS) and `next.config.mjs` (which refuses to build or boot on a
// policy nobody chose), and covered by `npm test`. A policy expressed twice is a policy that
// disagrees with itself the first time one copy is edited.
//
// Three rules, in the order they matter:
//
// 1. The client never asserts WHO it is. Any actor, principal, tenant or ACL header arriving from
//    the browser is DISCARDED before the request is forwarded. Identity is resolved server-side
//    from the deployment's own signal (a seeded dev persona offline, the platform's signed
//    assertion when the service is behind an identity-aware proxy).
// 2. Framing is an allowlist, never a wildcard. `frame-ancestors` is `'self'` when nobody named
//    a parent origin, and any entry carrying an asterisk, plus the literal `null` a sandboxed
//    iframe presents, is REFUSED rather than honoured or quietly dropped.
// 3. CORS is per-tenant. A tenant's origin is allowed only if the operator registered it. There is
//    no fallback to `*`, and an unset allowlist denies rather than opening up.
//
// Both allowlists are read in THREE states, and the middle one is the whole point. A module
// doing `parseAllowlist(env.UI_FRAME_ANCESTORS)` makes unset, `""`, `"   "` and `","` all
// produce `frame-ancestors 'self'` plus `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, byte for byte. An
// operator who empties the allowlist to name no parent HAS expressed an intent, and answering
// with the shipped default instead reads that absence as consent; worse, the deployment that
// lost the variable is indistinguishable from the one that locked itself down on purpose. A
// present-but-empty allowlist REFUSES, and `assertEmbedPolicyConfigured` runs that refusal
// from `next.config.mjs`, which `next build` and `next start` both evaluate, so the refusal is a
// build/boot refusal rather than a surprise on some later request.
